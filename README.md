# Yaml-to-Custom-Data-structure-Parser
This is a parser written in Haskell that parses a Yaml string and converts it to a custom data structure similar to JSON. it includes various monadic parsers to handle different types of YAML elements such as empty dictionaries, empty lists, null values, quoted strings, etc.. In a short, the entire directory is a bimaru game, where we had to implement functions to make the client run. There are 3 main tasks distributed in 3 different haskell files


# Installation
  1. Clone this repository **git clone ttps://github.com/your_username/your_project.git**
  2. Install Haskell Stack
  3. Run "stack run bimaru-client-3 -- $TOKEN" (the TOKEN is a unique UUID of the game: 9cfda689-fee4-4a87-b82b-49dd379f3cad)
  4. Run "Stack test" to run the test suite
