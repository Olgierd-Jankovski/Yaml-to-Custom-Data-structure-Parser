# Yaml-to-Custom-Data-structure-Parser
This is a parser written in Haskell that parses a Yaml string and converts it to a custom data structure similar to JSON. it includes various monadic parsers to handle different types of YAML elements such as empty dictionaries, empty lists, null values, quoted strings, etc.. In a short, the entire directory is a bimaru game, where we had to implement functions to make the client run. There are 3 main tasks distributed in 3 different haskell files
